       <p>I am a devoted developer, maker and innovative person who enjoys developing new features and tools for the good of the people, looking always for efficient and simple solutions usable for everyone.</p>
      <p>I am an Industrial Engineer who found out the web, mobile and system development as an essential tool to improve and facilitate any process. In this way, while I was working as Organizational analyst in a Hospital, I started developing and proposing the new Process Management and Risk Analysis tool for the hospital as a cross department platform where the information was shared in an online community platform where everyone contributing from their roles.</p>
      <p>From this experience working for 3 years in a Hospital, personal projects and thanks to my hunger of knowledge, I decided to start a Master in Applied Computer Science which I am currently doing, polishing my abilities and getting more knowledge from my professors.</p>
      <p>Despite of all this technical skills and work experience, in my free time I like to explore new cities and cultures, go to for a cup of coffee and speak with friends, discover new people, play the guitar and when it is possible I do Scuba diving escaping to deep and infinite Blue world.</p>
